"We have a tremendous amount of respect not only for Shane but all our former players," Dutiaume said.
The Kirkcaldy side will need to find a way past former netminder Shane Owen, who moved to Belfast in the summer after an impressive season between the pipes in Fife.
The weekend results could go a long way towards claiming a top three finish, and a quarter-final place.
With a win and a defeat each, Flyers and Belfast both have two points after two games in Challenge Cup Group B.
I imagine that will be our toughest challenge to date as a group, and we want to respond well to it.
"From what we've seen on tape, Belfast are an incredibly deep, well-rounded, physical and hard-working side," Dutes said.
That's according to head coach Todd Dutiaume who wants his team to rise to the challenge against last season's Elite League champions, with a ferry trip to the Northern Irish capital on Saturday followed by the return match at Fife Ice Arena on Sunday.
Fife Flyers will face their toughest test of the season to date when they take on Belfast Giants in a Challenge Cup double-header this weekend.

"Who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information?
"Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, and he never saw the call - heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is - they're almost a spy," Trump said.
The Los Angeles Times posted audio of Trump's spy remarks he reportedly made in front of a crowd of staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City.
The White House then attempted to cover up the exchange, according to the complaint.
Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump's reelection in 2020.
The whistleblower, an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer, alleges several White House officials accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
The president made the remark as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday to announce the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked anyone involved in the whistleblower complaint regarding his dealings with Ukraine as "almost a spy" and suggested their actions to expose his alleged impropriety were "treason," reported The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.

Saudi Arabia insists Iranian weapons were used and has invited U.N. investigators to assess where the strikes were launched.
Utmost pressure with every tool available should be applied to end the terrorist and aggressive conduct of the Iranian regime.
It is good at nothing but masterminding explosions, destruction and assassinations, not only in our region but also throughout the world," Al-Assaf said.
We have known that regime for 40 years.
He called the strikes a flagrant violation of international laws and a threat to international peace and security.
"We know very well who stood behind this aggression," Al-Assaf told the U.N. General Assembly.
Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf again blamed Iran for the Sept. 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities, which jolted global oil prices and temporarily knocked out nearly 6% of daily global crude production.
Saudi Arabia called on the world to apply "utmost pressure with every tool available" to end Iran's aggressive conduct, saying Thursday that the most effective way to control Tehran is to cut off its financial resources.

The union's lead negotiator on the GM contract, Vice President Terry Dittes, sent a letter to the company accusing it of "toying with the lives of hundreds of thousands of our UAW families."
The UAW did not let up its criticism even after GM reversed course Thursday.
Labor leaders and politicians hammered the company for what appeared to be a hardball bargaining tactic two days into the strike.
That earlier decision by GM ― which turned into national news ― created a wave of anxiety among employees who feared a lapse in coverage.
The move amounts to an about-face by Detroit-based GM, which said last week that the United Auto Workers union would have to fund COBRA benefits until the work stoppage ended.
The company assured there would be "no disruption" to medical, dental and prescription drug coverage.
The automaker said in a statement Thursday that it was "very concerned about the significant confusion" surrounding employee health insurance and that it had "chosen to work with our providers to keep all benefits fully in place" for workers on strike.
General Motors has decided to fund health care benefits for thousands of striking workers after the company initially moved to cut them off early in the nationwide work stoppage.

Maya Angelou's moving, honest portrait of her up and down relationship with Vivian Baxter -- the bold, smart, hard-drinking, pistol-toting woman who left Angelou with her grandmother for most of her childhood but reunited with her during her daughter's adolescence -- is full of wisdom, laughs and blockbuster sentences like, "there are times when no one is right and sometimes among family and children, no one can admit that there is no right, and that maybe at the same time there is no wrong," and, "She liberated me from a society that would have had me think of myself as the lower of the low.
The memoir can teach anybody to forgive, let go of a tough past and get along with a hell-on-wheels parent (and we mean anybody.)

6 Self-Help Books That -- Really! -- Help
A lot of people say we don't have a Constitution, well, we do.
It all goes back to one fundamental thing, this wonderful thing that we have in this country - that is our Constitution.
Bob continued: "The reason for that, the fundamental reason for that, is that they are defying the people of this country who are sovereign."
They're getting more and more outspoken and frustrated because they are beginning to realise they are fundamentally wrong.
It's not that they want a deal for Brexit, they just don't want Brexit.
Phoning in Mike Graham's show on talkRADIO, Bob said: "I think it's a watershed moment because the Brexit blockers in Parliament are beginning to show their true colours."
Members of Parliament have been engaged in a bitter battle with Boris Johnson and his Cabinet in an attempt to make sure Britain does not leave the European Union without an official agreement.
Caller Bob insisted MPs seeking to oppose Brexit in Parliament will soon realise they are in the "wrong" position.

Japan is also bolstering its defense role under its alliance with the U.S. and is launching a space unit and measures against cyber and electromagnetic attacks.
The defense paper also highlights that China's threat is expanding into space from the regional seas.
Since the second U.S.-North Korea summit collapsed this year, North Korea has fired 10 short-range missiles and projectiles deemed new and upgraded.
Its reaction to the North's recent tests contrasts to the low-key U.S. response.
The annual defense paper, approved Friday by the Cabinet, underscores Japan's fear of being targeted by its neighbor.
Japan has raised its caution level about North Korea's missile capability, saying in a defense report that the country resumed missile tests while taking no concrete denuclearization steps and had succeeded in making miniaturized warheads.

Swami Vivekananada had given the message of harmony and peace to the Parliament of Religions, and not dissension.
"The lack of unanimity amongst us on the issue of terrorism dents those very principles that are the basis for the creation of the UN," PM Modi remarked.
This was his second address to the General Debate at the UN, five years after his maiden speech as Prime Minister in 2014.
When we raise our voice against terror, it is with seriousness and anger," said the Prime Minister in a 20-minute speech in Hindi, in which he also spoke about India's fight against global warming and its development initiatives.
We belong to a country that has given the world Buddh (Buddha's message of peace), not 'Yuddh' (war).
Without naming Pakistan, PM Modi said there needed to be more anger globally about what terrorism was doing to humanity.
"For the sake of humanity, the world has to unite against terror," PM Modi said in his address.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the UN General Assembly today, stressed that the international community needs to unite against terror and work on consensus on fighting terrorism, which, he said, is among the biggest challenges not for any single country but for the entire world.

"Furthermore, sanctions are slowing down our progress, inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable," he said.
These achievements are in spite of the continued albatross of the illegal economic sanctions.
While Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society, the President said, more could have been achieved had it not been for the illegal sanctions.
He applauded Southern Africa for solidly standing by Zimbabwe in calling for the unconditional removal of the two-decades-old embargo.
The President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).
He further dismissed the embargo as an attack on the rights of citizens.
Illegal and ruinous sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have markedly slowed down the country's development, President Mnangagwa has said.

Some of Morrison's critics on the left see a world they fear, or perhaps secretly the almighty battle they want, when they make the Prime Minister out to be like Trump.
Trump is divisive in Australia and his friendship with Morrison may alienate some Australian voters, which means copying the President is no guarantee of victory.
Compulsory voting stays the hand of anyone who wants to appeal to the edge and forget the middle.
Those around Morrison are not planning a Trumpification of the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the intensely partisan tactics that work in the United States cannot work in a world where elections are won and lost in the centre.
But political tactics do not transfer so easily across the Pacific.
So when Morrison needs answers on how to win the next election, he will no doubt consider Trump's formula - and whether it works in November 2020.
He complained about the media on Wednesday for running "completely false" and "completely misleading" accounts of his climate policies.
And Morrison does not have to say "fake news" to echo the President at times.
Scott Morrison will consider Donald Trump's formula, but it's unlikely he'll follow it
