Turning to one of the key issues before Member States, climate change, he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent, was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures.
But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and other partners, his country will regain stability, which was in the interest of the region and the world.
"With the help of our international partners, we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism," he said, stressing that the task would not be easy, especially given the "violence, cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab."
And while he called Somalia "historic" example of reform, resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction, he cautioned that despite tangible progress, the country still faced many challenges, first and foremost those related to security, on which "everything depends."
He went on to express his country's pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections.
He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity.
Somalia's progress towards reconstruction was moving ahead, but Mr. Mohamad said "one cannot remain deaf and blind" to pockets of global discontent and the effects of poverty, inequality and unfair globalization.
Somalia is "the perfect example of the success of the multilateral system," President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed told the UN General Assembly on Thursday, while acknowledging that the Horn of Africa country still needed international and regional support and cooperation, particularly to deal with threats from Al-Shabab.

Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said.
It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.
Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG.
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys.
Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.
In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate.
Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup.
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.

All four were convicted of "undermining the authority of the army" and "conspiring against the state," in a verdict delivered away from the media.
It's the highest-profile conviction among Algeria's political and business elite since Bouteflika's ouster in April.
The remaining two, sentenced in absentia to 20 years, include former businessman Farid Benhamdine and former defence minister Khalid Nezzar.
Those currently in Algeria include Said Bouteflika along with Louisa Hanoune, the chief of the Lawyers for Workers's Party, and two intelligence chiefs, General Mohamed Mediene - who headed the secret service for 25 years - and General Athmane Tartag, a former ex-spy chief.
Two remain abroad, thought to be in Spain.
According to local news citing Miloud Brahimi, one of the defence lawyers, six people were convicted overnight in the closed-door trial in Blida.
Said Bouteflika was considered by many as the true power behind his brother after he suffered a stroke in 2013.
The brother of Algeria's deposed president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and three associates have been jailed for 15 years for plotting against the state, following an expedited trial.

In the early nineties, the rocky infrastructure was thought to have no religious association.
The archaeology here goes back 8,000 years.
There are other sites that remain un-excavated.
"I think it's a misconception that there is no archaeology here," says Peter Magee, an archaeologist at the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism.
Its excavation has revealed a complex history of the people who lived there.
Named Church and Monastery of Sir Bani Yas, the site is believed to date back around 1,400 years.
Originally discovered in 1992, the archeological treasure has recently opened to the public.
Located around 200 kilometers from the UAE's capital Abu Dhabi, on the eastern coast of Sir Bani Yas Island, lies the country's oldest Christian site.

Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.
We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.
Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: "This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital.
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.

The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies.
Facebook, which is more widely used in Hong Kong, does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations.
After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation, Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts, including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI, which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media.
The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform's terms of service and "because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed," the official said in an interview with The Associated Press.
Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations.
The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies, expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities.
Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong.

The intervention will heap pressure on Mr Johnson to water down the tax-cutting commitment he made during the Tory leadership campaign, which he is gambling on to be a big vote winner when a general election is called.
Echoing criticism made by opposition parties, the think-tank also concluded most of the tax cuts would go to those on higher incomes.
It warned the giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path," given the risk of leaving the EU without a deal.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy to lift the thresholds for both higher rate income tax and National Insurance.
The Prime Minister's proposed tax cuts will cost up to £26billion a year and mainly benefit wealthier households, the UK's leading economic think-tank warns today.
